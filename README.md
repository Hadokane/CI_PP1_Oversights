## Bugs

Let's hope very few!

1. Using the condensed Padding CSS was not effecting the navbar at all.

        .navbar_links {
            list-style: none;
            padding: 15px, 0px, 0px, 15px;
        }

    The solution was to simply break it up into specific padding commands:

        .navbar_links {
            list-style: none;
            padding-top: 5px;
            padding-left: 15px;
        }

2. Youtube & Bandcamp's Embeds were unresponsive Iframes by default and needed to be styled in order to adapt to the responsive layout of the website.

    This initial code specified a width and height for the video. 

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJQ0X-z65oQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    I'd believed that by setting the following, my issues would be solved and the design would become responsive.

            width="100%" height="auto"

    I was incorrect however and although the width now filled the container the videos height became a squashed strip that wouldn't change. The solution was to removed the width & height from the iframe and style it externally in the style.css sheet.
    
    I found guidance from this W3CSchools article. (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_iframes.asp)

    Which taught me that to maintain the 16:9 Aspect Ratio. I needed to set the container to relative and us either top or bottom padding to keep the iframe aligned with my responsive Bootstrap code. 
    
    The 56.25 came from using the needed 16:9 ratio (9/16=0.5625).

        .yt-container {
            overflow: hidden;
            padding-bottom: 56.25%;
            position: relative;
            height: 0;
        }

        .yt-container iframe {
            left: 0;
            top: 0;
            height: 100%;
            width: 100%;
            position: absolute;
        }

    I was then able to adapt this code and alter it for use with the Bandcamp embed, allowing that to also become responsive.
   
    This time to achieve a 9:16 Aspect Ratio instead I used the default height & width values (350/621=1.7778) to determine that "177.78" would be the perfect size for padding.
    
    I adjusted this further to remove some unneccesary blank space from the widget.

3. Couldn't find a property to change the image sizes within Bootstraps card system. Led to uneven sizing across cards which looks untidy and distracting. Expected adding h-100 to the class would fix it  but this only made sure the cards themselves were the same size, not the space occupied by their contents.
        ![Before_merch](docs/screenshots/merch_before.png)
        
    Decided to simply resize the images to all have the same proportions within Photoshop and then replace the ones in use. A simple solution that achieved the results I wanted without any code changes.

4. one of my <-hr-> elements was larger than others. (CSS added specifically for the screenshots to make the problem more visible).
The element was making use of bootstrap code in order to appear only on small devices.


    ![bug_4](docs/screenshots/bug_hr.png)


SOLUTION: Wrap the initial code within a <-div class="col"-> in order to have it conform to Bootstraps styling.

    <div class="col">
        <hr class="d-none d-sm-block d-md-none">
    </div>
