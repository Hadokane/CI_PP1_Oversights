## Bugs

Let's hope very few!

1. Using the condensed Padding CSS was not effecting the navbar at all.
    .navbar_links {
        list-style: none;
        padding: 15px, 0px, 0px, 15px;
    }

    Solution was to break it up:
    .navbar_links {
        list-style: none;
        padding-top: 5px;
        padding-left: 15px;
    }

## Future Enhancements

Further store functionality to remove third party website dependency?
Mailing List implementation?
